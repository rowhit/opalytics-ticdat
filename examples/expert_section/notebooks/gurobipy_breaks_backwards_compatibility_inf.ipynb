    "# gurobipy 8.0 breaks back compatibility with float(\"inf\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The `gurobipy` package has broken long standing `inf`  functionality with their 8.0 release. Historically (dating back at least 5 years) `inf` is replaced with `GRB.INFINITY` during model building.  The 8.0 release instead raises an exception upon encountering `inf`. (But only with constraint building - `inf` can still be used to represent unboundedness with variable creation).\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate this functionality, we will use a netflow.xlsx file that has infinity as part of the input data. Specifically, this file specifies an unbounded upper limit for product flow between Detroit and Seattle. Other than this one edit, the data is consistent with Gurobi netflow example [here](http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/7.5/examples/netflow_py.html). Since there is an optimal solution with slack on the Detroit to Seattle constraint, this edit doesn't change the optimization result.\n",

    "You can download this netflow.xlsx file from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18w1hwJDrh4RJWwJi2tZb3qVUisUT5Q2k?usp=sharing). "
